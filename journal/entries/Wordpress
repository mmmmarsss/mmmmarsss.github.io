 For my Nail Salon website, I checked out three real-world businesses: Nail Artistry (www.nailartistry.com), Polished Nail Bar (www.polishednailbar.com), and The Nail Lounge (www.thenaillounge.com). Each of these salons had their own vibe that really stood out. Nail Artistry did a great job showcasing their services with eye-catching images and detailed descriptions, making it super easy for clients to see what they offer. Polished Nail Bar had a cool section for customer testimonials, which added a personal touch and built trust. The Nail Lounge highlighted their online booking system, making it clear that convenience is key for their customers. Taking inspiration from these sites, I made sure to include detailed service descriptions, a testimonial section, and a clear call-to-action for booking appointments on my own site.

Working with WordPress has been a mixed bag. I really liked how easy it was to customize themes and use different plugins to make my site fit the Nail Salon's style. But I definitely struggled with the interface at times; there were so many options that it felt overwhelming! Figuring out how to arrange everything and make the layout user-friendly was tricky, but through trial and error, I started to get the hang of it. Despite the challenges, Iâ€™m glad I pushed through because WordPress really lets you create something unique and share your vision with others.
